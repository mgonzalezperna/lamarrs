# Project Charter: Development of a mobile-based live event support system.

## Project Title:
Lamarr

## Project Start Date:
01.04.2024

## Project Manager:
Martin Alejandro Gonzalez Perna

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a foundational prototype of a centralized control system for mobile devices in order to use them as light infrastructure for enhancing live events.

## Project Scope:
The scope of the project includes:
- Document the prototype's proposed architecture for future reference and development. Ensure portability.
- Design and develop a foundational prototype of the backbone of the control system.
- Create and implement the most basic client system to operate on the targeted mobile devices.
- Implement three example features for controlling mobile devices: synchronization, lighting effects, and some audiovisual enhancement.
- Conduct thorough testing with different hardware and quality assurance to ensure the reliability and performance of the prototype.
- Deploy the prototype at live events to gather feedback and evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing event experiences.
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and users to identify areas for improvement and further development of the centralized control system.

## Project Deliverables:
1. Requirements documentation
2. Design documentation
3. Server-side control system
4. Client-side app for the mobile devices to operate over.

## Project Milestones:
1. Design Documentation Phase Completion
2. Development of Server Side Control System Completion
3. Development of Client Side System Completion
4. Integration and Testing with Variety of Hardware
5. Deployment (Presentation)

## Project Risks:
1. Scope creep due to changing requirements
2. Technical challenges during integration
3. Hardware fragmentation
4. Time constraints


## Project Constraints:
1. Budget constraints
2. Time constraints due to project deadlines
